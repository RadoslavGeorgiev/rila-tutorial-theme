# Rila Tutorial Theme
This theme is meant to introduce to the principles of working with the [Rila Framework](https://github.com/RadoslavGeorgiev/rila-framework).

# Structure
All of the explanations about the process of creating a theme are done in the wiki of this repository. For each chapter, there is a separate  [release](https://github.com/RadoslavGeorgiev/rila-tutorial-theme/releases), so that you can check how the live code looks like.
